            <h3> Time in the Amazon Rainforest </h3>
            <p>
                These past two weeks have felt like some of our most adventurous yet! Kim and I reconnected for a day in Lima, having a blast walking around the historical center of the city and eating a menú del día (local daily lunch plate) at a mercado I’d been excited to visit. On May 22nd we flew to Iquitos, Peru, the largest city inaccessible by road in the world (only reachable by plane and boat). From the airport we took a tuk-tuk (a hybrid between a motorcycle and a car) to our hostel. I swear we rode the tuk-tuks over 20 times during our four days in Iquitos and I happily would’ve ridden them more if I could. See the pictures in my blog for a better idea of what they look like, but I swear over 95% of vehicles on the street were motorcycles or tuk-tuks. Everyone uses them as a form of transportation, we even saw a family of four fit onto a single motorcycle, and the idea of street lanes and pedestrian crossings are foreign concepts. Brazil is the most similar to Iquitos out of anywhere else I have been, but between being a huge city (over half a million people) and so deep in the rainforest, it is truly such a unique, special place.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iquitos was an amazing place to turn 23! Kim and I celebrated by visiting Mercado Belen (an outdoor market selling literally everything from alligator skulls to Rubik’s cubes to local plantains). We took a boat to visit a fancy bar for drinks that sat in middle of the river and had a swimming pool! At least seven tuk-tuks were taken on my birthday (23 would’ve been just too much) and we finished the night at a restaurant with cocktails and sushi. What an amazing day. This past year has been such an incredible, unforgettable time in my life. Thinking about just how much I feel I’ve grown, learned about the world and my privilege in it, and changed my perspective on so much is incredible. I’m so grateful for all the opportunities I’ve had these past seven months (can you believe it’s been that long!!!) and am excited to see where this new year takes me.
                <br>
                <br>
                A day after my birthday we embarked on a three day jungle tour. Our journey included taking a two hour van, then a tuk tuk, then a two hour ride on a sixish meter boat to arrive at the lodge we were staying in. The guides from our tour were so kind, knowledgable, and hardworking. While tours can sometimes be quite “touristy” (for lack of a better word), we found that this truly is the best way to go deep into the nature of the rainforest. Our lodge was quite remote, only next to a small town of about 200 people. Everyone got around by boat, either by rowing or by a basic motor. On the morning we woke up for sunrise, we even saw a dozen kids with their uniforms and backpacks off to school in their familys’ boats.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moments from the Jungle Tour Include: <br>
                - Going on a night walk and spotting a tarantula, a baby crocodile, an anaconda, bull frogs, grasshoppers, stick insects (bugs that camouflage into plants by looking like green sticks), and more!<br>
                - Seeing gray and pink dolphins in the river! First off, who knew dolphins lived in the rainforest?!? Second, the skin color is not the only thing that differentiates these two types of dolphins, pink dolphins can weigh over to four times that of the gray (400 lbs) and  have 40% more brain capacity than humans!<br>
                - Swimming in the river every day, climbing a tree and jumping a 20 foot drop from one of the branches into the water<br>
                - Fishing for piranhas (dont worry, a different area from where we swam). After great help from our guide Guillermo, I caught a baby piranha and we fried all the fish we caught to eat with lunch<br>
                - Attempting spear fishing, truly an impressive feat that takes calmness, precision and speed (unfortunately as you can see with the word attempt, I didn’t fair too lucky with this one, maybe its my city girl roots)<br>
                - Went on a night crocodile hunt in our boat! Guillermo was amazing and could spot even the most camouflaged animals from so far away<br>
                - Putting bug spray on by the hour and wearing pants and rain jackets at night to cover our bodies so there is less surface area for the mosquitos to bite. We’ve also been taking malaria medication just to be safe<br>
                - Fun fact: while our tour was quite adventurous, there is an even more venturesome excursion for those who desire: camping in the rainforest! Those selecting this experience had to catch and forage for everything they would be eating. They then slept in the shelter they built for themselves using only materials found in nature. We saw this option and thought about it for a good five seconds but then quickly opted for the comfort of our mosquito net covered beds…still plenty of adventure in our tour for us<br>
                - Relaxing in the hammocks! There was a nice amount of chill time in the tour too which was great for talking with others on the tour, reading, and playing chess. <br><br>

                The day after we returned from the tour, we left on a two night boat up the Amazon river to reach Iquitos in Colombia. There are two boat options for this journey: the faster ferry that takes 16-18 hours and the slower cargo boat (the one we took) that spans three days. We opted for the second because it would give us more time on the Amazon, was a cooler experience (you bring hammocks to sleep in and hang them up on the upper levels of the ship), and was cheaper with meals included. When we arrived two hours before the boat took off, there were already over 40 hammocks set up. Kim and I had ours placed a foot apart to ensure that no one would be between us and hung mosquito nets over them (honestly not that necessary bug wise but nice for a sense of privacy). We met a couple other backpackers on the boat and spent the day reading in our hammocks, hanging out on the roof of the boat, playing boggle and sudoku in our notebooks, and listening to music.

                <br>
                The boat was filled with mostly Peruvian families, most with an ease seeming like they’d done this trip many times before and it was so impressive seeing how well all the young children behaved. The boat stopped about a dozen times on the way to Leticia at smaller villages where people would get out. Kim met a mother traveling with her four day old baby and we wondered if she went to the city of Iquitos to give birth. On the lower levels of the boat was cargo ranging from rice, to fish, to live cattle and horses. When we stopped, materials would be unloaded in the villages and locals would come onto the boat selling snacks. Kids as young as five years old were helping their family make money. I feel very fortunate to have taken this boat and again so grateful again to become more aware of all my privileges. Many foreigners come to Peru just staying in touristy parts of Lima and Cusco. While both are wonderful cities, I’ve learned that this country has so much more depth that I believe should also be acknowledged: there are so many incredible geographical regions (rainforest, beach, mountains, desert), so many varying beliefs and passions, and so many different tiers of economic opportunity. I feel so much love for Peru and am already wanting to return.

                <br>
                Right now we are in Medellin, Colombia! Our friend Emilee is coming to visit next week and we are so so so excited. Will update our city adventures next time!

            <h3> Life in Huanchaco, Peru </h3>
            <p>
                For the past two weeks, I’ve been at a small beach nine hours north of Lima called Huanchaco. The hostel I’m staying at, ATMA, is like a magical black hole because it sucks people in and makes everyone never want to leave. I have already extended my stay three times and many other friends that I've met here have done the same. It truly checks off all the imaginary boxes every backpacker has of what makes an ideal hostel: clean, beautiful view overlooking the ocean where you can hear the waves crashing 24/7 and walk a minute to the beach, full kitchen with free coffee, free towels, four hammocks, a nice mix of independent space and social space to meet people, board games, and a great location in town. There are also yoga classes two times a day and about a dozen surf schools where you can rent boards within a five minute walk. At this point, if you haven’t already clicked on a new tab to check flight prices, I encourage you to do so now. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This is really the first two weeks I’ve been solo traveling because even though I was away from Kim in Cusco, I was with my Dad. I feel really content here in Huanchaco and present with myself. There are so many amazing friends I’ve made at the hostel because instead of the usual packing up and moving every couple of days, so many of us have decided to settle down for a bit to enjoy the beach and relax. Our nights have been filled with family dinners, pisco sour cocktails, board games, guitar playing, and movie nights. Because it’s a surf town, people are either here on a surf trip or want to get better at surfing during a chapter of their longer backpacking adventure.
                <br>
                <br>
                One day last week, our hostel took a group trip to a town called Chicama, famous for having the longest wave in the world. At one point, the record was set with a wave peeling for over 2.5 miles! The day we surfed there, we rented a dinghy boat to take us past the break and fight the current. It almost felt like cheating with how easy it was: whenever you caught a wave or were pulled too far away by the current, you would raise your hand and the dinghy would pick you up and take you back to the ideal wave catching spot, no paddle outs! While the waves weren’t perfect and they died out a bit while we were there, I felt captivated (and a little scared lol) watching them break. I also took my first private surf lesson last week and I am embarrassed to say that I have spent my entire life before this surfing regular when I am in fact goofy! This laughable realization came with the help of my instructor who is also goofy and said I kept looking like I wanted my back foot to be my left foot but would switch it last minute to my right. I also do basically everything else in my life left too so the pieces quickly add up.
                <br>
                <br>
                The one thorn of my time here so far is that I sprained my ankle pretty badly a week ago. I went out with some guys from my hostel to a field nearby and we played soccer against some locals. I was having a blast! It felt so good to play for fun but also have a taste of competition. Unfortunately, the ground was a bit uneven between concrete and turf and I twisted my ankle pretty badly. It’s been a week and a half of taking medication, icing, and walking as little as possible but it’s still not fully healed. I haven’t surfed since, but it's been a great place to read in a hammock, catch up on some more Cambly English tutoring, and spend time with friends here. It makes me so grateful that I haven’t had anything more serious happen to me medically during my travels so far (knock on wood). Hopefully I will be able to surf at least a couple times before I meet up with Kim, but after being so dormant recently, I just want to suck it up and let it fully heal. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Speaking of Kim, our reuniting is soon! We will meet up in Lima by the 22nd to fly to Iquitos in the Amazonian part of Peru. Iquitos is nestled so far into nature that you can actually only get there by boat or plane (so unfortunately no 20 hour bus for us). We will probably spend a couple of days there and then plan to take a boat to Leticia to begin our time in Colombia. I am so grateful for the time I have spent by myself, it makes me very excited about solo traveling on future backpacking trips elsewhere. That being said, I can’t wait to exchange stories with Kim about our adventures. I wouldn’t trade anything in the world for this trip with Kim and feel so grateful that we will have this special nine months that we can look back on together.

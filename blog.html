            <p> Heyo, Claire here!

                T-24 hours til we fly, how crazy! I am currently writing this outside of an ice cream shop around five minutes away from Prospect Park trying to soak in the last hours of New York fall sunlight. Being here these past six weeks has been a wonderful time of relaxing in between the closed chapter of UCLA and this new chapter that’s about to begin. That being said, I can’t wait for this adventure to start tomorrow! It seems like it’s been counting down for the longest time, since we were still in school even, and now it’s suddenly here. Kim flies in tonight and is going to stay with me in NYC for tonight before we take off from JFK on our 7am flight. We have a layover so we wont get into Buenos Aires until around 1am the next day.

                Although we don’t have a hostel for the night we fly in, we are booked for the five days after that. From there, we may take a ferry to Montevideo, Uruguay or relocate to a different neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Stay tuned for those adventures.

                There are so many parts of this trip that excite me. Meeting new people. Seeing the buildings, streets, bridges, and other infrastructure. People watching and walking through parks. Reading a book while en transit via bus. Improving my Spanish. There’s so much. When I fit all my stuff in my backpack for the first time yesterday, I prepared myself for just how minimalist I we’ll be living for these next eight months. Honestly it’s kind of heavy when you lift it up, but once you put it on your back the load lightens. That being said, it really convinced me to reevaluate every T-shirt, shoe, and pack of cards I am bringing. A couple weeks ago, Kim had a breakthrough idea for how to play our most beloved game, Catan. We found a pdf of all the cards and board pieces online and printed and cut them out. Not only a super lightweight solution, but also not to pricy!

                This trip blossomed in the fall of last year and I could’t be more grateful to have Kim as my partner through it all. There are for sure going to be times of exhaustion, disagreement, and frustration. But there will be many more moments of laughter, excitement, and and awe. We both are great at holding each other accountable and aren’t afraid for confrontation when it’s needed. It truly feels like we are a married couple on the brink of a phenomenal new journey. There’s no one else that I’d rather have along side me through it all.

                Thank you Kim for joining me on this trip. Thank you to our family and friends for getting us excited and encouraging us to pursue traveling when it was still so abstract. I’m thrilled to have a platform to share all of our experiences with you all. Thanks for tuning in, you’ll hear from us again soon.
                <br>

                Adios!

            <h3> First entry! Also a test for finishing the website </h3>
            <p> We have 6 more full days before we leave on our trip! I am working on this website and I am excited to see it go live. My goal is to have it done by the time we fly so all I have to worry about is improving it as time goes on. Lets hope it works! </p>

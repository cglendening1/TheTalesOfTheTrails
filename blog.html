            <h3> Iguazu Falls </h3>
            <p>
                Iguazu Falls is truly one of the most incredible places I’ve ever seen! It felt absolutely magical to be surrounded by nature so fully encompassing and grand. Not only did the number of waterfalls seem absolutely endless (there are 275!) but the size of each of them is massive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 1 in Iguazu Falls, Argentinian side:<br>
                - Walked a trail along lower part of the falls, so glad we did this first because it added scope to the size and number of them <br>
                - Walked a trail along the upper part of the falls, was incredible to be over the top of the falls after already seeing their great size. However, it was super hot by that point in the day and the large number of tour groups and sunshine tired us out a bit <br>
                - Took a mini train to a hike where lizards nearly two feet long crossed out path! I was so scared at first I was about to turn around lol
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 2 in Iguazu Falls, Brazilian side:<br>
                - A single trail that offers a more panoramic view of the falls as you walk along the path <br>
                - The most incredible part of the trail is saved for the end, the park has a built in walkway over the base of the falls. As you walk towards the center of the base, your whole body gets wet from all the mist from the water crashing down. You see the grandness of the falls in in a 360 degrees view <br>
                - Saw the biggest most beautiful rainbow in my life!
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 3 in Iguazu Falls, Argentinian Side:<br>
                - Returned back to Argentinian Side for the Macucu Trail, a 7km more remote path to admire the plants and animals in the jungle <br>
                - Saw ants that were one inch long (it was insane!), many colorful butterflies, lots of birds, and kim even saw a toucan <br>
                - Ate lunch (yummy PB&Js), read, and enjoyed the waterfall at the end of the trail
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking back, the most amazing part about this whole excursion was that it wasn’t planned. We never had a concrete framework of where we wanted to be and when per say on this trip, but we did have a rough idea of the cities in Argentina we wanted to visit. Iguazu Falls wasn’t on the list. This wasn’t for any particular reason except for the fact that I’ve been to Niagra Falls growing up. While Niagra Falls is quite captivating, I didn’t know if the cost of travel to Iguazu would be worth it if they were similar sights given our budget. But so many friends at our hostel raved about Iguazu and exclaimed it was something we MUST DO. We did some major airline searching and lucked into $90 round trip flights. Life Lesson: keep your mind open when traveling (and your schedule) because you’re going to find out about so many amazing things to do along the way!

                We’ve now been traveling for almost 40 days. Crazy right?!? It feels like it went from one week to one month so fast. It's a good reminder to soak it all in and appreciate every day I’m here. I’ve been trying to practice my Spanish a lot since I’ve been here. While I still have so much to learn, I’m proud to say that it’s really improved since the start of the trip! Speaking is still quite difficult for me, but that only comes with more practice.

                Kim’s family is visiting this week and I’m so excited! I’m in Cordoba for a couple days while she is with her family in Buenos Aires, but on Wednesday they are all going to meet me here! It’s going to be so fun to get to explore with them and have a taste of home.

            <h3> A Month In Patagonia </h3>
            <p>
                We have spent most of our days in March hiking or camping and I’ve realized just how happy and fulfilled it makes me feel. I was raised living amid New York City’s skyscrapers, bustling subway stations, and ambitious drive. Most people when they experience this city’s grandness for the first time feel the magic and wonder it brings. But for me, it’s been the different. I have become starstruck by the vastness of nature. I’d never camped until college, and this month especially has awed me and I feel like a little kid again. Our nine days in Patagonia’s Torres Del Paine National Park reinforced how content I feel when I spend time in nature. When walking the O Circuit, we passed through prairies, wetlands, mountains, and forests. We had sunny T-shirt days, windy rainstorms, hail, and snow flurries. With all of this weather and geography, one feels a deep sense of gratitude for the beauty of our world.
                <br>
                <br>
                Highlights of the Hike:<br>
                - Getting to meet an amazing community of backpackers! On the O Circuit, everyone follows the same route and stays at the same refugio sites for the first four days. We made so many incredible friends, exchanging stories about our days and outside lives. When separating, we left with hugs and excitement to reconnect out in the future.<br>
                - Making it over the John Garner Pass! On our hardest day, we hiked for nine hours through a mix of cold rain, hail, and snow to meet with the park’s Grey Glacier. Facing the cold and wind near the top of the pass truly felt like one of the hardest things I’ve ever physically done. I felt so proud of us when we completed our day.<br>
                - Getting to see the Torres! The park is particularly famous for three granite peaks that are considered to be a geological sensation. We hiked up to the Torres on our final day after many instances of seeing them from afar on earlier parts of the trail.<br>
                - Making hot chocolate every night before cooking dinner! Dinner meals include lentil soup, polenta, ramen, and instant mashed potatoes.<br>
                - Seeing the sky turn a mystical pink for sunrise at Refugio Paine Grande.<br>
                - Walking across the long and narrow suspension bridges along Grey Glacier. We could feel the floor of the bridge sway with every step we took. In the background were incredible views of waterfalls to our left and creeks below us.<br>
                <br>
                Learning Lessons:<br>
                - No need to bring a kilogram worth of tuna on a hiking trip of this length. It will likely smell up your bag and I can promise that you will not have the appetite for all that tuna. PB&J’s and banana chips on the other hand are well worth it. <br>
                - Don’t be stubborn and keep using a sleeping bag or mat that makes you cold. Good gear = good comfort, especially in cold weather.<br>
                - Bring trekking poles! I never used poles before this hike and only considered them because so many other backpackers raved about them. The positive reviews held true, not only were they amazing for evening out my backpack weight when walking but also for balance in wind and going downhill.<br>
                - Even if you leave your tent briefly, make sure you stake it down otherwise it might fly away.<br>
                - Do many more hikes and trips like this because they will change your life! Our world is beautiful and has so many different layers. Appreciating life outside of our own brings respect to the planet we call our home. <br>

                After a couple of rest days in Puerto Natales, we crossed back into Argentina to visit El Parque National Los Glaciares in El Calafate. Before this month, I had never seen a glacier or understood the science behind it. Not only is the accumulation and pressure of snow that creates a glacier astonishing scientifically, but as is it’s importance to our water cycle and understanding of prehistoric life. Glacier Perito Moreno in the park is surrounded by walkways visitors can use to see the phenomenon at different angles and heights. This 97 square mile glacier in particular is known for frequent chunks falling off the edge and the thunder like sound it produces as a result of glacier movement. It was incredible to sit and watch the ruptures drop snow chunks in the water.

                This week we’ve been in El Chalten, a small hiking town in Southern Argentina. Our arrival accidentally but amazing overlapped with an annual trekking festival in the town. We had a blast eating street food from local vendors and enjoying live music amid other travelers and local families. One incredible part of the town is it’s closeness to so many trails. El Chalten is quite literally nestled in between mountains and because of that, it’s a hiker’s paradise. We spent two nights at a Refugio called Piedra Del Fraile. It felt like a cozy log cabin and we spent the day playing board games, sharing conversation with others at the Refugio, and waking up to a beautiful morning of snowfall on our last day. It was also incredibly special to learn about Piedra del Fraile’s history. A refuge for many climbers in the past half century, it’s also been a base for many including Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell.

                <br>
                We’re back to Bariloche now (truly one of my favorite places I’ve ever been) and will soon cross back into Chile to visit Pucon. In two weeks I meet my Dad in Peru!!! Getting to experience part of this trip with him is something that makes me overjoyed. From a young age, he has always pushed me to explore and have a never ending desire to learn. I’m so grateful to share memories with someone who is such a big inspiration and cause of where I am today.

            <h3> Brazil! </h3>
            <p> Greetings from Ushiaia, Argentina, the most southern city in the World! After three weeks in Brazil, we flew in to start our month and a half of trekking in southern Argentina and Chile. In less than a week, we will start our eight day backpacking trip on the O trail in Torres Del Paine. We made reservations before we even arrived in South America and after hearing many stories and experiences from other backpackers, we are ecstatic to begin. However with great excitement also comes a bit of a need for preparation. With a trip of such great variation in climates, I only have a rain jacket and sweater and need to purchase a winter coat. Days on the trail can range from being sunny in the 60s to snowing with sub freezing temperatures. I must also be completely honest and confess that Kim and I have never backpacked before for more than a night LOL. But, I am not too worried, we have met many others with little experience but a love for hiking as well, and the distances we need to walk everyday to get to the next campsite range from around 8 to 12ish miles which isn’t too bad. While we hike on our own during the day, everyone stays at the same designated campsites at night. I’m excited for post trail hangouts where we all cook and debrief about the day.

            Highlights from Brazil:
            After Itacaré, a beach town in the state of Bahia, we took a bus and ferry to Salvador to celebrate Carnaval. Salvador is a beautiful city rich with African influenced culture, food, and music. The city sits on the Atlantic Ocean and the historic district is lined with beautiful cobblestone streets and colorful colonial architecture. Because we were only there for a week, and it was the week of Carnaval, we really only saw Salvador’s Carnaval and not the city of Salvador itself. That being said, I would love to go back to visit the city for itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            But boy oh boy was Carnaval in Salvador one of the coolest things I’ve ever experienced. If you have ever been to a pride parade (which you totally should if you haven’t), picture that one-hundred fold with so many people in colorful and creative costumes celebrating in the streets. Then imagine all the most famous musical artists in your country standing on top of trucks and riding circuits around the city with people following and celebrating as they passed. That’s Carnaval in Salvador. The party is free for everyone, and everyone celebrates. I’ve never been in crowds as big and glorious in my life. In fact, a couple years ago, Salvador broke a Guinness World Record for having the largest street party in the world (during Carnaval celebration of course). People wait all year for this sacred holiday that originates from the start of Lent (“Carne Vale” which means “Goodbye to Meat”). The hostel we stayed at was big reason for why we had such a wonderful experience. On the day we arrived, the owner gave us a rundown on everything we needed to know about getting around, what to bring when going out, where to celebrate, and much more. We all went out together and more or less, everyone that was staying at the hostel was there for the same days so we all got to know each other very well. It’s so much different from the normal dynamic of people in hostels coming and going separate ways every day. I am so grateful for all of the friendships I made and getting to be part of such a special celebration in Salvador. For being a super spontaneous decision to come here, it is truly something so awing that I will never forget.
            <br>
            <br>
            From there we took a bus ride to Rio (36 hours…yikes) but we made it through. To be honest the first day wasn’t all too bad, it was waking up in the morning and knowing we still had 12 hours left that made it seem like time was passing by oh so slowly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Rio highlights:<br>
            - hiked to Christ the Redeemer, most people take a train to the top of this statue but we couldn’t recommend the hike more. It is a bit steep, but there aren’t many people that do it and it feels so nice to be in nature. We also saw monkeys on the way down! <br>
            - Took cable car up to Sugarloaf Mountain, incredible views of Copacabana Beach and the city<br>
            - Went to the Winners Parade, the final parade of Carnaval showcasing the top five samba schools of this year’s celebrations. Rio’s Carnaval is a bit different than Salvador in the sense that there are almost two celebrations: the party in the streets and the performances by the samba schools that you have to pay for. We figured that Carnaval would be over by the time we reached Rio but when a friend told us about this final celebration, we were excited to see the parade. With over 1000 people in each performance, it felt absolutely magical, majestic, and a logistical feet. The party went all night and the final school started their performances at sunrise. It was enchanting to see such intricate costumes, choreography, and floats that each school put together<br>
            - Watched the sunset at Pedra do Arpoador and swam at Ipanema’s beach<br>
            - Rode bikes from Rio’s bike share along the water near Copacabana<br>
            - Went to a fúbol game for Rio’s team and the most popular club in Brazil: Clubs de Regatas do Flamengo. The stadium, Maracanã, is huge and was famously used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympics as well as for games in the 1950 and 2014 World Cups. Fun fact: acai is sold at the stadium<br><br>

            Many people have told me Rio is one of their favorite cities in the world. We were only there for a couple days, and even in that time I was able to see the great beauty of this city. There was truly something going on at every second of the day and the mix between urban, beach, and rainforest was unique and stunning in so many ways. That being said, it was also a city of great inequality. More than anywhere else we have traveled so far, the juxtaposition between wealthy high-rises and people barely making a living wage was profound. Traveling in itself is such a great privilege that I have become more and more aware of on this trip. Not only has being in Rio made me much more conscious in the ways I have been given opportunities at home, but also around the world. For example, just because I was born in the United States, I have the privilege of having an American passport. And solely because of this and not anything else that has to do with me as a person, I have so much more of an ability to visit different countries and travel because of visa restrictions. Inequality presents itself in so many forms and my time in Brazil has shown me all the more ways I have been given these privileges.

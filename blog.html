            <h3> Feeling at Home in Santiago </h3>
            <p>
                We’re now into our final week of volunteering at the Merced 88 hostel in Santiago, Chile. It’s crazy to think that we’ve been in this city for almost a month and are already over three months into our trip. We have become so close with the other volunteers working here. One of the more difficult parts of traveling is constantly meeting new people. Just as you finally joke around and get close to someone, you often go separate ways and continue traveling. But because all of us volunteers are here for at least a month, we have spent so much time hanging out after our shifts, going on day trips around the city, and eating meals together. One night we even did a family spring roll night. I am so happy Kim and I settled down for a month of our travels and I’m so grateful for the friendships we have made here. One of our friends is even coming with us on the next leg of our journey to the Atacama Desert!
                <br>
                <br>
                A new update, I’ve started to spend my mornings as an English tutor through a platform called Cambly. I couldn’t recommend it more to those who are traveling and want to make some money on the side. The sessions range from five minutes to an hour and there are students wanting to learn English from all over the world. Occasionally, they have prepared material that they want to work on, but most of the time it’s just us having a conversation to get to know each other. Over the past week I’ve met some incredible people, some of which include:
                <br>
                <br>
                - A 17 year old girl from Saudi Arabia that also loves math and basketball and aspires to be a neurosurgeon <br>
                - A man from Korea that is learning English before he goes to Hawaii in two months to get married <br>
                - A data scientists living in Shanghai that is learning English to also help with his coding skills
                <br>
                <br>
                These are only some of the many people I have been able to talk to. I’m constantly moved by
                the students I meet on Cambly. It’s captivating to exchange life stories with people of so many varying ages, professions, and lifestyles from all over the world. I’m so grateful and more aware of the privileges I’ve been given in all the educational opportunities I’ve had thus far. Many of the students I’ve worked with have learned new languages and skills independently with the power of the internet. Their drive and dillegence is so inspiring and puts perspective to my own academic pursuits.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another exciting update, our friend Kate is visiting us and Chile!!! Having her here feels warm and cozy like when you cuddle up in a warm blanket. I’ve missed her so much and it feels so special to get to share part of this trip with someone we know so well. Some other highlights of these past couple weeks include:
                <br>
                <br>
                - Getting to surprise Kate at the airport and spending hours playing a new card game called Golf that she taught Kim and me<br>
                - Wandering through the maze of graffitied streets in Valparaiso, admiring the art and the breathtaking views of the hills filled with colorful houses<br>
                - Picnicing on the Concon sand dunes with Kim and Kate and watching the sunset over the Pacific Ocean<br>
                - Hiking up to the Bahai Temple: one of only 12 in the world and admiring the grandness and beauty of the temple overlooking the skyline of Santiago<br>
                - Visiting the Natural History Museum with my friend Chiara and learning all about the different geographic regions of Chile (this country has so many biomes!)<br>
                - Going to Fantasilandia (amusement park only a metro ride away) with our friends Mateus and Chiara, haha not going to lie some of rollercoasters really made us dizzy afterwords<br>
                - Going glamping in San Jose del Maipo, playing cards, having a picnic, and seeing the stars the most clearly we have this entire trip<br>
                - Visiting the more financial district of Santiago (Las Condes) and reading in the vast Bicentario park<br>
                - Finally booking our flight in person from São Paulo to Ushuaia after many hours of customer service help and frustration with our credit cards not going through<br>
                - Exploring Los Dominicos, a plaza with many local artists selling their crafts and trying Mote, a Chilean juice made with peaches, grain, and cinnamon
                <br>
                <br>
                That’s about all for now, updates soon to come from the Atacama Desert.

            <h3> Surfs Up in Pichilemu!</h3>
            <p>
                This weekend, we stayed at one of my favorite hostels yet! We get Sundays and Mondays off from working in our Santiago hostel (more on that to come later) and wanted to take a trip out of the city. Between friends’ recommendations and research, we decided on a small town just over three hours away called Pichilemu. It’s considered to be the surf capital of Chile, also offering beautiful beaches with black sand to relax and swim. Our hostel, SudEste, was right on the water! Like literally walk out of your room, turn right, and your at the ocean! Not only did it have a pool that overlooked the beach, but you could hear the sound of the waves crashing and could smell the salty air right from your door. A nice other perk is that because was farther away from the city center, our beach and hostel were so much less crowded. So much time to chill in the hammock, say hi to the hostel dogs, and appreciate the panoramic view of the ocean. To top it off, we lucked out and got a room to ourselves with a private bathroom attached! This very rarely happens and we danced with joy when we found out. Needless to say, it felt like an absolute retreat.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of things I was most excited about when visiting Pichilemu was being able to surf. I haven’t gotten out into the waves since July in California and how cool is it to get to go in another country?!? It was super easy to rent a wetsuit and board for the day and there was a beach that was perfect for beginner and intermediate surfers. It was such an incredible feeling to get to be back in the water (and haha I did realized how out of surfing shape I’ve gotten these past couple months). When I left the ocean and was walking towards the rental place, I saw a horse drawn carriage moving along the street. Much to my surprise, it was none other than Kim inside getting a ride into town! Apparently, she had passed the man driving the carriage along the road multiple times that day and he offered her a ride. So nice! We sat on the beach snacking on ceviche and then relaxed for the rest of the afternoon. For dinner, we brought a picnic to Punta del Lobos, a point break that the most experienced surfers go to. We caught the sunset while watching people shred through waves over six meters tall! It was insane!!!
                <br>
                <br>
                Or first week of volunteering at Merced88 in Santiago has been going pretty well too! Kim is doing amazing in the restaurant. On her third day, the chef was off and she ran the kitchen by herself! It’s fun getting to watch her cook and be in her element. She’s learned how to make the entire menu, anything from fajitas to chorrillana chilena. My job is a lot less exciting but slightly easier. I help clean the bathrooms and do laundry. It’s nice to get to zone out for a bit and listen to music and my tasks always finish early so I really only have to change the laundry. When I’m done, I get to hang out on the roof where we have nightly activities like trivia and karaoke. Last week, karaoke turned into a salsa dancing class when one of the guests, a dance teacher, got us all excited about learning new moves. It’s been a nice change to stay at the same place for a long time and get comfortable. There are also seven other volunteers all around our age who are all so nice. We’ve been hanging out around the hostel and most of us are trying to improve our Spanish by practicing with each other.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, best news saved for last…WE’RE GOING TO BRAZIL FOR CARNIVAL!!! We officially booked our tickets yesterday. We weren’t planning on going to Brazil at the beginning of this trip, but so many people told us it’s one of the most beautiful places in the world. It’s a once in a life time experience and being in South America already, we are so close! Our rough timeline of the trip has also changed given the political situation in Peru and we have no plans for February. We will likely be in Salvador for the celebrations, more updates to come later!

            <h3> First Days in Santiago </h3>
            <p>
                Today we start volunteering at a hostel in Santiago, Chile for a month! Through World Packers (similar to Workaway) there are many opportunities to work at a hostel in return for free accommodation. Merced 88, the hostel we’re volunteering at, is so incredibly nice! It has a pool table, rooftop bar, and a great central location. This is the first time Kim or I have worked a program like this and it’s so nice that there are eight other volunteers our age here as well. Kim will be assisting the chef in the kitchen at night and I will help with cleaning. We only work five hours a day and get two days off a week which will be perfect for small trips out of the city. It’s a great opportunity to save some money since it’s more expensive here than in Argentina and we are very much looking forward to getting to settle down for a bit of our trip. In the last couple weeks, we’ve stayed at seven different hostels and even slept on an 18 hour bus. It’s been fun to see so many different parts of town, but taking so much transportation has started to become logistically tiring.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay now back to what you must be really wondering about: our 18 hour bus ride. Yes, the trip was indeed that long from Bariloche to Mendoza in Argentina. We packed plenty of snacks and downloaded lots of movies onto our phones in preparation. To be honest, it was so much easier and more enjoyable than I thought. All the seats had so much room and reclined with leg rests. It was significantly better than when you’re crammed in a middle seat on an airplane for hours and can barely rest your head on the table in front of you. But let me tell you, this bus was on a strict schedule. When I’ve taken long busses in the US, they give you time every couple hours to get out, go to the bathroom, and buy some food. At exactly 1PM our bus pulled out of the station and the few times it stopped for gas you had to be quick and timely when getting off. If you weren’t back in time, it would not wait for you. But fast forward a day and we arrived in Mendoza!
                <br>
                <br>
                Mendoza is the heart of wine country in Argentina and we took advantage of that. We stayed in the capital city for three days and spent a good chunk of time wandering around town. It’s a lovely region with many beautiful town squares, convenient transportation, and most famously, incredible wine. We rented bikes for a day and did a self guided tour to three different wineries just outside the city. Malbec is the most well known and popular type of grape grown there but they also had chardonnay and other varieties. Mendoza also offers many olive oil tasting that we of course tried as well. Other highlights include getting a new haircut (I’ve been loving it short lately), going to a parilla for dinner, and becoming obsessed with a new two player card game called Spite and Malice.
                <br>
                <br>
                From there we took another bus (11 hours) to Santiago, Chile. It took us four hours to get through immigration but considering the fact that we were literally driving through the Andes Mountains (!!!) it was a small price to pay for our journey. It’s always a little startling when we transition from smaller towns to the fast pace of big cities. It feels like you are waking up from a dream and suddenly have to be alert and attentive to the world around you. But the city is beautiful and the adjustment is absolutely worth it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Santiago has such a different, electric energy from other cities we’ve visited so far. Graffiti is very widespread here and is a popular form of expression. Streets are lined with murals of all colors and designs. The metro system is incredible and everyone is so warm and friendly. We shopped for vegetables at the biggest and most crowded food market (Mercado la Vega) I think I’ve ever been to. It was a huge warehouse filled with more food than I could even imagine and a great destination given that Kim and I want to do more cooking. Other highlights include hanging out at a skatepark, celebrating New Years at a hostel party, and hiking to the top of the Cerro San Cristóbal for sunset.
                <br>
                <br>
                The other day, we went on a walking tour downtown and learned about the political history of the last 50 years. In 2019, upcharges of the metro system resulted in massive protests of millions of people. Since then, there have been efforts to write new constitutions and many have had a renewed memory of the military dictatorship in the late twentieth century. This afternoon, I am going to visit the Museum of Memory and Human Rights which explains more about the coup in the 70s and the victims of terrible human rights violations. Looking back at my schooling in the United States, I feel incredibly disheartened that I learned nothing about any political history in South America. All three countries we’ve visited so far had dictatorships just fifty years ago yet our education system teaches the American Revolution on repeat. We need to have more understanding for the greater world around us and do better.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are already a quarter of the way through our trip which is absolutely crazy. When I think about everything we’ve done in Argentina, it still feels like there is so much to come. But looking back, these past two months have passed within the snap of our fingers. We’re both so sad knowing our time in Argentina is over. The country is incredibly diverse in its geographical features and all is so beautiful. Starting our trip to Buenos Aires where there are so many people passionate about their home country felt empowering and exhilarating. We are so grateful for our time there as well as in Iguazú Falls, Cordoba, Bariloche, and Mendoza. Up next, an amazing time in Chile!

            <h3> First Days in Santiago </h3>
            <p>
                Today we start volunteering at a hostel in Santiago, Chile for a month! Through World Packers (similar to Workaway) there are many opportunities to work at a hostel in return for free accommodation. Merced 88, the hostel we’re volunteering at, is so incredibly nice! It has a pool table, rooftop bar, and a great central location. This is the first time Kim or I have worked a program like this and it’s so nice that there are eight other volunteers our age here as well. Kim will be assisting the chef in the kitchen at night and I will help with cleaning. We only work five hours a day and get two days off a week which will be perfect for small trips out of the city. It’s a great opportunity to save some money since it’s more expensive here than in Argentina and we are very much looking forward to getting to settle down for a bit of our trip. In the last couple weeks, we’ve stayed at seven different hostels and even slept on an 18 hour bus. It’s been fun to see so many different parts of town, but taking so much transportation has started to become logistically tiring.

                Okay now back to what you must be really wondering about: our 18 hour bus ride. Yes, the trip was indeed that long from Bariloche to Mendoza in Argentina. We packed plenty of snacks and downloaded lots of movies onto our phones in preparation. To be honest, it was so much easier and more enjoyable than I thought. All the seats had so much room and reclined with leg rests. It was significantly better than when you’re crammed in a middle seat on an airplane for hours and can barely rest your head on the table in front of you. But let me tell you, this bus was on a strict schedule. When I’ve taken long busses in the US, they give you time every couple hours to get out, go to the bathroom, and buy some food. At exactly 1PM our bus pulled out of the station and the few times it stopped for gas you had to be quick and timely when getting off. If you weren’t back in time, it would not wait for you. But fast forward a day and we arrived in Mendoza!

                Mendoza is the heart of wine country in Argentina and we took advantage of that. We stayed in the capital city for three days and spent a good chunk of time wandering around town. It’s a lovely region with many beautiful town squares, convenient transportation, and most famously, incredible wine. We rented bikes for a day and did a self guided tour to three different wineries just outside the city. Malbec is the most well known and popular type of grape grown there but they also had chardonnay and other varieties. Mendoza also offers many olive oil tasting that we of course tried as well. Other highlights include getting a new haircut (I’ve been loving it short lately), going to a parilla for dinner, and becoming obsessed with a new two player card game called Spite and Malice.

                From there we took another bus (11 hours) to Santiago, Chile. It took us four hours to get through immigration but considering the fact that we were literally driving through the Andes Mountains (!!!) it was a small price to pay for our journey. It’s always a little startling when we transition from smaller towns to the fast pace of big cities. It feels like you are waking up from a dream and suddenly have to be alert and attentive to the world around you. But the city is beautiful and the adjustment is absolutely worth it.

                Santiago has such a different, electric energy from other cities we’ve visited so far. Graffiti is very widespread here and is a popular form of expression. Streets are lined with murals of all colors and designs. The metro system is incredible and everyone is so warm and friendly. We shopped for vegetables at the biggest and most crowded food market (Mercado la Vega) I think I’ve ever been to. It was a huge warehouse filled with more food than I could even imagine and a great destination given that Kim and I want to do more cooking. Other highlights include hanging out at a skatepark, celebrating New Years at a hostel party, and hiking to the top of the Cerro San Cristóbal for sunset.

                The other day, we went on a walking tour downtown and learned about the political history of the last 50 years. In 2019, upcharges of the metro system resulted in massive protests of millions of people. Since then, there have been efforts to write new constitutions and many have had a renewed memory of the military dictatorship in the late twentieth century. This afternoon, I am going to visit the Museum of Memory and Human Rights which explains more about the coup in the 70s and the victims of terrible human rights violations. Looking back at my schooling in the United States, I feel incredibly disheartened that I learned nothing about any political history in South America. All three countries we’ve visited so far had dictatorships just fifty years ago yet our education system teaches the American Revolution on repeat. We need to have more understanding for the greater world around us and do better.

                We are already a quarter of the way through our trip which is absolutely crazy. When I think about everything we’ve done in Argentina, it still feels like there is so much to come. But looking back, these past two months have passed within the snap of our fingers. We’re both so sad knowing our time in Argentina is over. The country is incredibly diverse in its geographical features and all is so beautiful. Starting our trip to Buenos Aires where there are so many people passionate about their home country felt empowering and exhilarating. We are so grateful for our time there as well as in Iguazú Falls, Cordoba, Bariloche, and Mendoza. Up next, an amazing time in Chile!

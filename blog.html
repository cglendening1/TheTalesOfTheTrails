            <h3> A Week in Uruguay!</h3>
            <p>
                We saw Lorde at Primavera Sound music festival and it was amazing!!! Okay it’s been over a week since I’ve updated what we have been up to, and there are so many stories to tell about the past week and our trip to Uruguay. But first, picture this: rain pouring down as the sky turns purple and fades into night, bold and bright lights changing from blue to red to gold on a grand stage that is soaking wet, Lorde singing all of my favorite songs of hers, mosh pit dancing, endless laughing and smiling. All of this magic happened yesterday when Kim and I went to see Lorde with two of our friends we met at a hostel in Uruguay. The energy felt unified and liberating, it’s crazy to think that we had only bought our tickets two days before. What a wonderful welcome back to Buenos Aires!
            <br>
            <br>
            Last week we left Buenos Aires for Uruguay. We took a ferry across Rio de la Plata to Colonia Del Sacremento, where we stayed for two nights. Colonia is one of the oldest towns in Uruguay and its historical district is lined with stone roads and cute restaurants that looked similar to what the small Italian town looks like in Call Me By Your Name. However, we were quickly struck by how much more expensive everything was in this new country. Before coming on this trip I knew very little about the political situation in most South American countries but wanted to know more. Already visiting two countries, I have learned just how progressive Uruguay is. It is probably the most stable country in the continent. Seeing that in contrast to the inflation and history of political shifts in Argentina surprised me given that both countries are next to each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            Colonia and Montevideo really made me think more about this trip. Not being in the movement and vastness of Buenos Aires, the smaller towns gave me time to think more about what I would be doing every day and put perspective to the length of this trip. To be honest, I started to feel lonely. I have Kim of course but it really is an adjustment to go from knowing your group of solid friends in college to meeting and saying goodbye to so many people. As someone who is usually go go go, I also realized that this trip isn’t just about visiting cities, but taking time to do what I want to do. Things that I never had time to make big efforts to actively do on a day to day basis. Whether its reading more, doing yoga, or taking time to sit and think, these are all things I have been doing so much more and am so grateful to get this opportunity for it all.
            <br>
            <br>
            After Colonia, we bussed further east to Montevideo for a couple days. Given the priciness, we mostly cooked all of our own food during this week, cheap meals like pasta, in the hostel. Interestingly enough, meat and bread and dairy are pretty affordable, but exports, for example the $10 jar of Nutella, were quite expensive. We loved the social scene of our Montevideo hostel. Highlights include going out at night, going to the Feria de Tristan Narvaja (street fair), playing cards, visiting parks, and making sangria with friends from our hostel. Good life lesson: never attempt to buy tickets to anything after a couple of glasses of wine. I tried to buy Primavera Sound tickets and nearly spent $1000 USD thinking the currency was in Argentinian pesos. Dont worry, the tickets that we actually ended up getting a couple days later were only $60 a person. Phew.
            <br>
            <br>
            On November 8th, we left Montevideo for Punta del Este. It’s a beautiful and grand beach town that many wealthy Uruguayans and Argentineans visit for vacation. Highlights include:
            - an incredibly nice hostel with a pool, view of the beach from its patio, games like boggle and chess, and we practically had the place all to ourselves <br>
            - Huge houses that lined the beach and a port with hundreds of beautiful sailboats <br>
            - Too many relaxing beach spots to read, do yoga, and watch the sunset from <br>
            - Moral of the story, it felt like we were truly in the ease of a relaxing vacation
            <br>
            <br>
            We met two girls our age from Britain in Montevideo and that really helped the trip click for me. Being able to hangout with them and talk with them felt so comfortable. We walked all around the city with them and went to the music festival it was awesome!
            <br>
            <br>
            This week: were back in Buenos Aires and just booked our tickets for Iguazu Falls! More to come on that in the next couple of days but conclusion to all of this, we are both so glad we spent time in Uruguay, definitely recommend because it is so beautiful and exciting.

            <h3> The First Week Traveled</h3>
            <p>
                It feels like we already live here! I mean, I guess technically we are living here, but more in the sense that it feels like it’s our neighborhood and we have blocks and streets memorized. We have our favorite happy hour spot in San Telmo, have parks we already want to go back to, and we are now the people at the hostel welcoming newcomers when others used to welcome us. Even in these past couple days, I’ve learned perspective of just how long this trip is going to actually be (in the best way but also in the sense that I need to pace myself). We have had some pretty full days and I realized I have to slow down (haha which Kim did tell me on the first day but I couldn’t admit she was right until day five). If there’s anything I’ve realized about Buenos Aires beyond my fondness of it is that it’s the city of indulgences. It’s a city of cafes, ice cream, steak, incredible pastries, wine, dancing, singing, and love. The enjoyment of pleasures feels so grand and we are soaking it all in. It’s too much to write everything we’ve done but heres a short list

                <br>
                <br>

                - Visited a ton of fairs: San Telmo, Recoleta, Gaucho
                <br>
                - Kim took a crochet class and is learning so fast
                <br>
                - Visited the national library, a ton of parks
                <br>
                - Eaten more than our fair share of empanadas, gelato, and steak
                <br>
                - Joined a drumming class that we wandered into after drinking beer at our favorite happy hour place
                <br>
                - Bussed to Palermo and stumbled on a festive pride parade! Such a fun celebration. Tons of restaurants and stores have pride flags in the window
                <br>
                - Go to McDonalds whenever we need to go to the bathroom and get WiFi when we’re out and about
                <br>
                - Went to the halloween party on the rooftop of our hostel and then to a club nearby after. So many people wore incredibly thought out costumes it was so epic! Kim got back at 5am people party hard here
                <br>
                - Taken busses and the metro all over! Never have I loved the convenience and accessibility of a city’s transportation more
                <br>
                - Saw the movie Argentina, 1985 in theaters! We’re trying to learn a lot more about Argentinian history
                <br>
                - Reading in the park! Kim’s reading a book about Eva Peron and I’m reading about the history of Argentinian soccer in preparation for the World Cup in a couple weeks

                <br>
                <br>

                Signing off from Buenos Aires! We leave tomorrow for Uruguay for a week before coming back to the city for another two weeks. From there, who knows?!? Rosario, Cordoba, Iguazu Falls?!?

            <h2> Date: October 29th, 2022 </h2>
            <h3> We Made It! I Love It Here! </h3>
                <p>Sleeping in the airport was really not as bad as I thought it would be. We landed in Buenos Aires and got our bags by around 1AM in the morning. We ran to our second flight from Bogota, Colombia to Buenos Aires out of worry that the two hour delay from our New York flight would cause us to miss it. We ended up making it with around 15 minutes to spare and catch our breath. The second plane had such little space between the seats on the six hour flight that I wished I appreciated our space in the first flight more. But at least we made it! It would’ve been so hard to have our bags land in Argentina on a different flight than we did. Luckily we never had to deal with that. Not having a hostel reservation for the first night, we decided it would be best to just hold up there until 6:30AM when we could hop on a bus to the city.

                <br>
                <br>

                My experiences with arriving at US airports late at night haven’t been to great so I had no idea what to expect in Buenos Aires. I was very pleasantly surprised. The Starbucks, McDonalds, and Havana cafe were open all 24 hours and there were many others spending the night in the airport awaiting an early morning flight. Kim put her sleeping back on the floor to try to get at least a couple hours of sleep before our full next day in the city and I eventually followed. At 5:45 we arose and located our bus. People were so kind and helpful the entire time we were asking the logistics of paying and where to find the station.

                <br>
                <br>

                Just past 8AM, we were able to go into the hostel and drop our bags off even though our room wasn’t going to be technically ready until 3PM. For me it was at that moment that it felt like we were truly at the start of our travels. We got a tour of the common spaces and saw the charming rooftop that overlooked the local streets. There’s a bar up there that serves coffee during the day and drinks at night. We are each staying here for ten dollars a night in a room with four beds for the next week. Natalia, the woman who helped us out at the front desk, was so incredibly friendly and gave us such a warm welcoming which we felt so grateful for after our three hours of sleep on the airport floor.

                <br>
                <br>

                We went to a cafe for breakfast and got coffee and medialunas, a hybrid between a roll and croissant that we’ve realized to be a popular breakfast item here and also now is one of my favorite pastries. We also ate scrambled eggs (hues revueltos) to give us some protein and prepare for our walking day ahead. We spent the next couple hours wandering, getting on a free tour of the city and then leaving because it was only in spanish and we didn’t understand anything, and went to a Western Union to get money exchanged. We bought 4 empanadas for two dollars total and went back to the hostel to nap.

                <br>
                <br>

                In the early evening we woke up for round two of exploring. We walked upon a happy hour for two pints of beer totaling to a dollar each and decided this was a must do to start our evening festivities! The vibe was fun and fresh and cute and it was a great first place to cheers to being here and doing all of this. After already having empanadas and coffee, we decided dinner was perfect to try another food Buenos Aires is known for: steak. We got a recommendation from a restaurant from another woman staying at the hostel and the praise was well earned. More beer, salad, bread, and steak filled us up in an absolutely delectable and filling meal. We sat at a table next to these two men in their 20s who we overheard speaking english. They were also friends that met in college and decided to take a couple months to travel together. It already feels like we’ve met this community of people who are just so grateful to explore. There was also a guy on our plane who looked around our age and we figured was backpacking. We even ran into him on the street on our morning walk the next day what a small world! We walked back to our hostel with him, got his number on WhatsApp, and found out he was also headed to Montevideo when we are next week. It’s so cool!

                <br>
                <br>

                After dinner we continued walking and exploring the area and it was now dark out. We got delicious ice cream, I learned the word probar, which means to try, and we sat in a park content with our day. Feeling the tiredness start to hit us, we got back to the hostel around 11:00 and finished off with a chill night.

                <br>
                <br>

                <em>Day 2</em>
                <br> <br>
                We woke up, had more medialunas, cafe, y huevos revueltos (yummy) and made a plan to walk to the hip trendy youthful district of Palermo. We stopped in multiple parks along the way, met a nice old man with a friendly dog, snacked on fruit from a street market, and slowly made our way over to Palermo. We ate an incredible Peruvian salad and sandwich for lunch and took a look at some of the clubs that we might go to later tonight. Realizing we needed to take more cash out before festivities tonight, we stopped at another Western Union (LOVE THEM) and got more money. We took the underground metro home. It was not only fast and clean, but super easy to take and gets out right near our hostel. The longer we stay at Parla hostel, the more grateful I am for its location. It’s not in the trendy areas, but its central to so many neighborhoods and is near so many metro stations and bus stops. One day we plan on just taking the first bus we see and letting it take us on our own adventure somewhere.

                <br>
                <br>

                We relaxed at the hostel from around 6pm to 8:30pm and met our new roommate from the Netherlands. Reenergized, we wandered back to the area where we had happy hour and dinner yesterday. Our first drink was at a bar with huge arched brick ceilings and walls. It was beautiful and the vibes we exciting and warm as other guests were waiting for a band to start playing. We tried one of Buenos Aires’s most common beers, cerveza honey, and it was my favorite one so far. Kim likes the golden beer more. We walked further south for dinner. Yay!!! We ate at 10 just like the locals do! We split a pizza, hamburger, and of course more beer and felt excellently stuffed. I will say, I was at first quite surprised by the amount of pizza in Buenos Aires, there are literally pizzerias on almost every block, but it is all because of Italian immigration in the early 1900s. I have to find more positive adjectives to describe the food I’m eating because I keep using the word delicious, but all of the food I’ve had is exactly that. The meat was juicy, flavorful, and so appetizing. We went to a more hip looking bar nearby and each had a mojito and then slowly made our way home. On the way we stopped to listen to local artists singing and people dancing on the sidewalks. I love it here. I never want to leave.

                <br>
                <br>

                We finished the night on the rooftop of our hostel. We met a kind man traveling from North Argentina to see Coldplay. Many hostels and hotels are fully booked all around the city for next week because the band is playing. We also met a mother and daughter in our hostel who have traveled from Mendoza for the same reason. Chris Martin and the band are all the craze! We never made it to Palermo and instead spent the night singing songs and talking in a mix between English and Spanish, smoking a cigarette, and finishing off with you guessed it, another beer (honey for me of course). Please don’t wake me up if I’m sleeping, I’m so happy right now this doesn’t feel like real life. Everyone is so kind, friendly, open and warm. I am writing this in the morning of day three and already want to keep traveling forever.

            <h2> Date: October 25th, 2022 </h2>
            <h3> We leave tomorrow!!!</h3>
            <p> Heyo, Claire here!

                T-24 hours til we fly, how crazy! I am currently writing this outside of an ice cream shop around five minutes away from Prospect Park trying to soak in the last hours of New York fall sunlight. Being here these past six weeks has been a wonderful time of relaxing in between the closed chapter of UCLA and this new chapter that’s about to begin. That being said, I can’t wait for this adventure to start tomorrow! It seems like it’s been counting down for the longest time, since we were still in school even, and now it’s suddenly here. Kim flies in tonight and is going to stay with me in NYC before we take off from JFK on our 7am flight. We have a layover so we wont get into Buenos Aires until around 1am the next day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although we don’t have a hostel for the night we fly in, we are booked for the five days after that. From there, we may take a ferry to Montevideo, Uruguay or relocate to a different neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Stay tuned for those adventures.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are so many parts of this trip that excite me. Meeting new people. Seeing the buildings, streets, bridges, and other infrastructure. People watching and walking through parks. Reading a book while en transit via bus. Improving my Spanish. There’s so much. When I fit all my stuff in my backpack for the first time yesterday, I prepared myself for just how minimalist we’ll be living for these next eight months. Honestly it’s kind of heavy when you lift it up, but once you put it on your back the load lightens. That being said, it really convinced me to reevaluate every T-shirt, shoe, and pack of cards I am bringing. A couple weeks ago, Kim had a breakthrough idea for how to play our most beloved game, Catan. We found a pdf of all the cards and board pieces online and printed and cut them out. Not only a super lightweight solution, but also not too pricy!
                <br>
                <br>
                This trip blossomed in the fall of last year and I could’t be more grateful to have Kim as my partner through it all. There are for sure going to be times of exhaustion, disagreement, and frustration. But there will be many more moments of laughter, excitement, and and awe. We both are great at holding each other accountable and aren’t afraid for confrontation when it’s needed. It truly feels like we are a married couple on the brink of a phenomenal new journey. There’s no one else that I’d rather have along side me through it all.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you Kim for joining me on this trip. Thank you to our family and friends for getting us excited and encouraging us to pursue traveling when it was still so abstract. I’m thrilled to have a platform to share all of our experiences with you all. Thanks for tuning in, you’ll hear from us again soon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adios!

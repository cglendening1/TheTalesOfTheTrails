            <h3> Medellin and Jardín, Colombia</h3>
            <p>

                We’ve probably heard people talk about their great experiences in Medellin more than any other place we’ve been in South America. It’s been described to us as magical, alive, and transformative. After two weeks here filled with exploring different neighborhoods, learning about the city’s rich history, and eating delicious food, I can truly say these descriptions more than hold up to be true. Medellin is the second largest city in Colombia and is rapidly growing in population size and in international tourism. Nicknamed “El Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera” (City of the Eternal Spring), year round temperatures sit between 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit with light showers occasionally occurring in the afternoon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Less than fifty years ago, the city suffered through drug trade, political instability, and great violence. I want to share our experiences to counteract the stereotype that many foreigners still have of the city being “dangerous”. I want to explain what we learned during our time here, but please know that given the recentness of so many dark experiences, Colombians are still trying to piece together their own history. I am very grateful for what we learned about the city’s history and it’s transformation through tours, museums, and the experiences of those who lived through the past half century in Colombia. I very much encourage you to learn about it on your own, as I want to understand more as well. I will say, this does not mean watching Narcos. The Netflix series has pained so many Colombians for its misrepresentation of their homeland and Pablo Escobar, characterized as a robin-hood in the series’ heist adventure format. Our tour guide only even referred to this man as “him”, for saying his name in public causes great uncomfort. While I have never watched the show myself, he is responsible for the murder, displacement, and hurt of thousands of people. Our tour guide made a point I will never forget: “During 9/11 in New York, over 3,000 people died and you would never imagine people talking about Osama Bin Laden lightly. Why are people buying T-shirts with Escobar’s mugshot when he is directly accountable for tens of thousands of lives.”

                Medellin is a brilliant city that has so much to do. One of the strongest reasons for its transformation is its action towards building parks, libraries, and metro stations throughout all parts of the city, not just the wealthy districts. It has made the city so much more unified and what I believe to be an example of how governments should allocate public funding towards the greater good of the entire city. Here are some highlights:
                <br>
                - Visiting Parque Explora: a science museum in the city and probably my new favorite museum. I literally felt like a kid in a candy shop and my 11 year old self in a Lego store when I was there. It’s similar to San Francisco’s Exploratorium in the sense that there are a bunch of hands on experiments that are both kid and adult friendly. They have incredible exhibits, an aquarium, and a planetarium! A MUST VISIT!!!<br>
                - Taking a tour of Comuna 13: a neighborhood rich with history, it started as a community for agriculturalists. Starting in the 80s, it became a dangerous battleground between the military and guerrillas. In the early 21st century, the city government put escalators into the hills of the comuna to make it easier and faster for locals to get around. It is very uncommon for large cities in general to invest heavily in low income neighborhoods, but this led to an incredible transformation. National and international tourists started visiting Medellin to see these escalators and the rest of the city. It is now a neighborhood thriving on dance, music, restaurants, and more. <br>
                - Participating in a walking tour around the historical part of Medellin: our tour guide was INCREDIBLE and explained the transformation the city has had from the start of the early 1950s all the way through now <br>
                - Taking the metro: the subway is the pride and joy of Paisas (term used for locals who live in Medellin). Since opening in the 1990s, it has been accessible financially and geographically to people from all over parts of the city. Because of this, it is truly a form of public transportation. People treat it with such care, I didn’t see a single piece of trash on the ground and no body eats or drinks near it.
                - Going to a fútbol game for Medellin’s team Atlético National. The energy was electric and it was so cool to feel the city’s pride in a sport that is so popular here. <br>
                - Taking the cable cars up to Parque Arví: the cable cars are also part of the city’s public transit system as a way to offer transportation to neighborhoods that sit in the higher elevated parts of the city. We did a ropes course in the park and hiked a bit through the forrest. It’s amazing that nature is so easily accessible to this wonderful city. <br>
                - Having so much incredible food! We have been eating more vegetarian in the past month and have had the most fresh and flavorful menu del Dias and juices
                - Taking a two day trip to Guatapé and reuniting with our friend Emma, who we met months ago in Santiago. We climbed stairs up to the towns iconic rock that overlooks the many ponds, lakes, and streams in the area. We hiked to a waterfall and wandered the colorful streets of the enchanting town.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our amazing friend and old roommate Emilee also visited! After two days in Medellin, we spent the rest of her week with us in Jardin, a town in the Andes mountains just four hours away from Medellin. The city has a beautiful central square and is known for its colorful houses that line small roads.
                <br>
                <br>
                Highlights of Jardin: <br>
                - our amazing hostel that was only a 20 minute walk from town but was so immersed in nature. The included breakfast was delicious, we lucked into getting a private room for the three of us, and we did yoga overlooking a beautiful pond in the morning. <br>
                - Going on a coffee and honey tour! The road to the main entrance of the property was closed so we walked from our tuk-tuk (how incredible it was that we got to appreciate them again after Iquitos) down a trail to arrive. We learned about the thorough process involved in production, picked beans ourselves, and saw the twenty different nests of the bee varieties that lived there. Colombian coffee is delicious and entirely picked by hand. After a half hour of picking ourselves, we each only collected enough beans for three cups of coffee. It really makes you understand the importance of buying fair trade products. There are so many luxuries that come easy to us that we take for granted. Many workers get paid by how much they collect and it makes a substantial difference supporting companies that treat their workers well if financially possible. <br>
                - Walking 16 miles on a hike that took us to a swimming hole and waterfall! We passed many banana trees, cows, and local farms. Such a wonderful day, it was of course accompanied by an packed PB&J for lunch. <br>
                - Going paragliding! The weather in Jardin feels perfect, it is cool and a bit breezy at night with the sun coming out during the day. We took a Jeep to an overlook of the town, paragliding with a view of the mountains around us and the beautiful town below us. <br>
                - Getting so much time to laugh and be silly.  Having Emilee with us was so refreshing. After being on the move for so many months I was starting to feel in a lull and tired of meeting then leaving people all the time. It was so great to spend time with someone who already knows us and to share part of our trip with her.
                <br>
                <br>
                After Emilee left, we took a night bus up north to Santa Marta. This the first time for both of us seeing the Caribbean Coast, and it is stunning. More updates to come on this next time. On another note, we purchased our tickets home for July 5th. With only a couple weeks left in our trip now, I have mixed emotions of being so excited to see friends and family but also incredibly sad that this trip of a lifetime has come to an end. I am so used to staying in dorms, learning about a town’s public transit system, and meeting new people that it seems more comfortable to keep doing this than get situated at home and into a routine.

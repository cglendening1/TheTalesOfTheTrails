            <h3> World Cup Excitement and Kim's Family Visited! </h3>
            <p>
                VAMOS ARGENTINA!!! Only one game away from a World Cup title! Words can’t even describe just how grateful we feel to get be here during this tournament. From going to a cafe in Buenos Aires for the 7am opener against Saudi Arabia to watching the victory against Mexico in Plaza Intendente among thousands of fans, we’ve been able to see it all. We’ve watched games in Cordoba, Iguazu Falls, Buenos Aires, and Bariloche. For the first half of the game against Croatia we were on a plane 30,000 feet in the air as passengers cheered and chanted celebrating Messi’s goal. I’ve never felt anything as thrilling and electric in my life. The comradery and sense of unity among people dancing and singing in city centers is magical.
                <br>
                <br>
                Yesterday Kim and I arrived to Bariloche just in time for the end of the game and rushed to celebrate in the city center. Located in Argentina’s Patagonia region, the town has many opportunities to kayak, hike, and enjoy nature. We are incredibly excited to enjoy the high of 20 degrees Celsius after coming from 39 degrees in Cordoba (102 deg F).
                <br>
                <br>
                We had the most incredible time with Kim’s family in Cordoba. We spent a day exploring and learning about Plaza San Martin in the city’s historical district. Another day we bussed three hours away to a small German town called La Cumbrecita in the Grand Sierras to swim in a waterfall and had some incredible locally brewed beer. If there was a buzz word for the week it was for sure alfajores. These pastries sandwich dulce de leche cream between two cookies and are an absolutely delectable treat paired with coffee. I swear we had at least one every day and even made our own taste testing game comparing flavors. Other highlights include going on a hike in a national park to see condors, getting to cook and eat dinner on the apartment’s patio overlooking the city, playing Catan with the set we’ve been traveling with for months, and celebrating Kim’s sister Christina’s birthday. Kim’s family has practically adopted me as one of their own and it makes me so happy and feel so loved. I am so grateful for them. We also had a washing machine in the apartment and I had my own queen bed which was a huge bonus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kim and I were apart for a couple days last week when she was with her family in Buenos Aires and I had just arrived to Cordoba. While it was fun to get a taste of independence, it made me realize just how grateful I am to be doing this trip with her. It feels so special and memorable to be able to travel and experience this trip together. We have gotten into such a good routine of living around each other. Sometimes I like to get up earlier to have breakfast. Other times we separate for an afternoon to do our own thing. It makes traveling a really nice balance between
                having a partner in the journey but not feeling like you have to give up your own space and things you want to do. Communication is key and it’s great that we can be so honest with each other.
                <br>
                <br>
                Up next is more time in Bariloche. This morning we went in a gondola with Kim’s parents and saw stunning views of the city and tomorrow we’re going kayaking before they unfortunately have to leave on Friday. We are staying here for sure through the World Cup final and possibly for Christmas too?!? It’s so festive here, there are so many trees in store windows and houses lined with colorful lights. Also a plus, our hostel has two incredibly adorable dogs. After that is Mendoza before we go to Santiago, Chile for New Years. Life is great.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you so much for following us on our adventures, it means so much that we get to share our experiences with our friends and family.
                <br>

                Signing off, <br>

            <h3> Iguazu Falls </h3>
            <p>
                Iguazu Falls is truly one of the most incredible places I’ve ever seen! It felt absolutely magical to be surrounded by nature so fully encompassing and grand. Not only did the number of waterfalls seem absolutely endless (there are 275!) but the size of each of them is massive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 1 in Iguazu Falls, Argentinian side:<br>
                - Walked a trail along lower part of the falls, so glad we did this first because it added scope to the size and number of them <br>
                - Walked a trail along the upper part of the falls, was incredible to be over the top of the falls after already seeing their great size. However, it was super hot by that point in the day and the large number of tour groups and sunshine tired us out a bit <br>
                - Took a mini train to a hike where lizards nearly two feet long crossed out path! I was so scared at first I was about to turn around lol
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 2 in Iguazu Falls, Brazilian side:<br>
                - A single trail that offers a more panoramic view of the falls as you walk along the path <br>
                - The most incredible part of the trail is saved for the end, the park has a built in walkway over the base of the falls. As you walk towards the center of the base, your whole body gets wet from all the mist from the water crashing down. You see the grandness of the falls in in a 360 degrees view <br>
                - Saw the biggest most beautiful rainbow in my life!
                <br>
                <br>
                Day 3 in Iguazu Falls, Argentinian Side:<br>
                - Returned back to Argentinian Side for the Macucu Trail, a 7km more remote path to admire the plants and animals in the jungle <br>
                - Saw ants that were one inch long (it was insane!), many colorful butterflies, lots of birds, and kim even saw a toucan <br>
                - Ate lunch (yummy PB&Js), read, and enjoyed the waterfall at the end of the trail
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking back, the most amazing part about this whole excursion was that it wasn’t planned. We never had a concrete framework of where we wanted to be and when per say on this trip, but we did have a rough idea of the cities in Argentina we wanted to visit. Iguazu Falls wasn’t on the list. This wasn’t for any particular reason except for the fact that I’ve been to Niagra Falls growing up. While Niagra Falls is quite captivating, I didn’t know if the cost of travel to Iguazu would be worth it if they were similar sights given our budget. But so many friends at our hostel raved about Iguazu and exclaimed it was something we MUST DO. We did some major airline searching and lucked into $90 round trip flights. Life Lesson: keep your mind open when traveling (and your schedule) because you’re going to find out about so many amazing things to do along the way!
                <br>
                <br>
                We’ve now been traveling for almost 40 days. Crazy right?!? It feels like it went from one week to one month so fast. It's a good reminder to soak it all in and appreciate every day I’m here. I’ve been trying to practice my Spanish a lot since I’ve been here. While I still have so much to learn, I’m proud to say that it’s really improved since the start of the trip! Speaking is still quite difficult for me, but that only comes with more practice.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kim’s family is visiting this week and I’m so excited! I’m in Cordoba for a couple days while she is with her family in Buenos Aires, but on Wednesday they are all going to meet me here! It’s going to be so fun to get to explore with them and have a taste of home.

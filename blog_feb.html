            <h3> Atacama Desert, Chile and Itacaré, Brazil </h3>
            <p>
                One of the coolest parts of our trip that I didn’t think much about before traveling has been getting to experience so many different climates. Last week, we visited the Atacama Desert, the second driest place on Earth, falling only to the polar deserts. This incredibly arid region is home to salt flats, geysers, sand dunes, and much more. Oddly enough, it ended up raining half the time we were there. It was such a unique experience that we were grateful to see. It only rains a couple times a year in the small desert town we stayed in, San Pedro, and it was very different from the typically sunny weather. On another note, we flew to Brazil a couple days ago and are now in a very different environment. Think beaches lined with palm trees, warm ocean water and some of the most lush vegetation I have ever seen. Across other parts of the South American continent are mountains covered in snow, rivers running through forests, and vast grasslands. It’s been incredible to see the difference of towns and lifestyles across varying climates and the beauty of nature in each place.

            Some highlights from the Atacama Desert: <br>
            - Kate was back on the trip with us! So fun to get to see her again and share more of our trip together. We also were so lucky that our friend from volunteering in Santiago came with us as well <br>
            - Rented a car to get around (was significantly cheaper than booking tours). I naively reserved the cheapest car, because ya know gotta keep to the budget, but it was a two wheel manual drive when a four wheel would have definitely been easier and more comforting. Our friend was an astounding driver!!!! and our car (which we named Percy for her perseverance) was quickly beloved <br>
            - Played lots of fun board games when it rained! Ticket to ride, Catan, Wavelength, and lots of cards. Our hostel was so cute and the common space felt like we were cozied up in a cabin <br>
            - Hiked past sand dunes, canyons, and salt flats. Deserts are incredibly grand. In forests or on beaches, one feels the surroundings elements of nature (trees, rocks, water). It is truly the vastness of the desert and the seemingly endless amount of open space that I feel puts humanity in place. It is quite humbling to be in the desert. It truly puts scope to our size and relevance in a world so big. <br>
            - Big road trip vibes! Lots of auxing during drives, premade lunches, and good laughs <br>
            - Our hostel had a pool! A prefect way to cool off after our day excursions <br>
            - Made family dinners, read in cafes, and saw an incredible parade for a Chilean holiday <br><br>

            On February 8th, we left Chile to start our month in Brazil. A mere 31 hours of traveling from a metro to a bus to three flights to a taxi to a ferry to two busses later we made it to Itacaré! All the tiredness on this journey felt easily worth it when we finally arrived at the beach. A town of 28,000, Itacaré is a tropical beach town. We’re here for a couple more days until we go to Salvador for Carnival.

            Some highlights from our time in Brazil so far: <br>
            - Visiting some of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen! A local guide walked us around different beaches, describing different plants and vegetation. We shared some coconuts, tried sea urchins, and saw monkeys sitting on phone lines <br>
            - Surfed and boogie boarded! Kim and I spent most of the entire second day at the beach in and out of the water. Kim made some friends playing volleyball too <br>
            - Have eaten so much delicious food! Acai, coxihnas, fish, papaya, cheese, and more. There are jackfruits and coconuts growing right along the beach. Caprinhas are sold everywhere too, I very much recommend a caprinha with maracuja <br>
            - Found a bar showing the Super Bowl last night. A group with a big reserved table from Philadelphia was so kind and invited us to join them! It felt like a true potluck that comes with the big game <br>
            - Our hostel has had live music performances three out of the four nights we’ve been here. A little bit of an adjustment for me when I was tired from our long travel day but now it is so fun to hear so much live music. So many restaurants and bars play music with people dancing on the street. We are in a very touristy part of town and I am curious if this happens during less touristy seasons or if it is a lead up to Carnival <br>
            - The pace very much feels like a small beach town. The speed of life is very relaxed and tranquilo
            <br>
            <br>
            A new update, after Salvador we will be making our way down to Rio for a couple of days. However, travel in and out of Salvador and Rio is very expensive right now because of Carnival. With flights costing nearly 300 dollars for one way tickets between the two cities, we decided to instead opt for a much cheaper and more fun alternative: a 30 hour bus ride. I know you are all excited and incredibly jealous of this bus trip. But hey, we’ll let you know how it goes and can send lots of pictures. I’m now thinking that our 18 hour bus ride from Bariloche to Mendoza wasn’t all too bad. It was really just practice and now we’ve leveled up to the big leagues.

            Happy almost Valentines Day! <br>

            <h3> Time With Dad in Cusco, Peru </h3>
            <p>
                Dad flew home this morning after visiting me for the past two weeks. We spent a day and a half in Lima and then the rest of our time in Cusco. Getting to see him after months apart was in itself so special. Getting to travel with him and learn about such a beautiful country made this part of my trip even more amazing. Ever since I was a kid, he has encouraged me to learn languages and strive to be curious about the World. I’m so grateful to have such a supportive person I can look up to and an incredible travel partner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Cusco is a fascinating city rich in culture and history. Once the capital of the Incan Empire and then conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century, it mixes different architectural styles of the two. But since the late 20th century, Peru has made great efforts to restore Incan culture by preserving ruins and history. Getting to visit Machu Picchu and learn about its science and engineering feats with my Dad is something that will stay sacred to me and I will never forget. We walked through stone walls built over 500 years ago that still hold just as firm today and surround hundreds of man made terraces used for farming. Machu Picchu is sometimes referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas'' because it was one of the few establishments undiscovered by the Spanish and that is why it is so well preserved today. However, while Machu Picchu is the most well known example of the incredible prosperity of the Incas, it is only one of many sites visitors can see to learn more about their achievements. We visited Pisac and Ollantaytambo in Sacred Valley, Moray’s farming terraces, and Sacsayhuamán just on the edge of the city of Cusco.

                Across these different sites, we were greeted by llamas and alpacas. Having never seen either before this trip, I was taken over by their cuteness and an awe of the thorough process used to turn their fiber into yarn and then clothing. But let me tell you, the altitude surrounding Cusco was high. The city itself sits 3400 meters (about 11,150 feet) above sea level. We visited Mountain Vinicunca (popularized on social media as Rainbow Mountain for its arrangement of minerals that looks like colors of the rainbow) which stood at 5200 meters (17,060 feet). Not only did a glacial melt ten years ago make the colors visible, but it stands so high that it’s too cold for trees to grow.

                Other fun parts of my time with dad include: <br>
                - Attending a cooking class! We visited the local market and learned about Peruvian cuisine. There are over 3,000 varieties of potato growing in the Peruvian Andes. My dad learned how to prepare ceviche and I made lomo saltado, two popular dishes eaten here<br>
                - Walking around the narrow and beautiful streets around San Blas, the more artsy region overlooking the historical part of the city and watching the sunset<br>
                - Hiking up to the Cristo Blanco statue. Roughly 80 percent of the Cusco population practices Catholicism. In the main square, Plaza de Armas, sits two Catholic churches lined with beautiful art built nearly 400 years ago and still used to this day<br>
                - Trying roasted Guinea Pig, colloquially known as Cuy, a very popular local dish. Before Spanish colonization brought animals like pigs and cows to the Andes, there were very few animals that lived there naturally due to the mountain terrain. Guinea Pig remains a popular food, we even saw signs for the Guinea Pig festival happening the first week of May!<br>
                - Drinking lots of coca tea and muña tea to help with altitude adjustment and digestion. It’s very common to buy coca leaves to directly put in your mouth for ten minutes to help with headaches and fatigue. Just make sure you take them out of your backpack before airport security because it’s not allowed in many places outside of Peru<br>

                In December 2022, protests across Peru emerged following former president Pedro Castillo’s removal from power. Anger spurred especially across the country’s Andean and Amazonian regions. There are still occasional peaceful demonstrations in regions close to Lake Titicaca, however we have seen nothing political so far. When talking to many guides living in Cusco, they say it has had a substantial impact on tourism. While the city felt filled and full of excitement for us, it was apparently only 10% of what typical peak season looks like. We passed restaurants with dozens of tables that only had one or two groups sitting there. The city’s economy is almost entirely reliant on tourism and it’s sad to hear of so many small businesses struggling. Our time so far in Peru has been incredible, met with so much beauty in nature, so many kind people, and such a vibrant culture. I’m so grateful to get to spend time here and I couldn’t recommend it more.

                Tonight I take a night bus to Huanchaco, a surf town nine hours north of Lima. I’m hoping to be there for a couple weeks to work on my Spanish, tutor more on Cambly, and most exciting, do a ton of surfing!!! Kim is currently in Arequipa and will hike the Salkantay Trek in a week. We plan to meet up by my birthday at the end of May to visit Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon. Being apart for a month was an intriguing option for both of us. I wanted to visit more of Northern Peru and her Southern. We both are ecstatic about sharing this trip together and this is a great opportunity to get a taste of independence and improve our Spanish individually.

            <h3> Back to Buenos Aires </h3>
            <p>
                Kim bought brownie mix from the grocery store and baked in the hostel last night. It started as a fun way to have a chill night after our recent late nights out and ended up being a mini dessert party with a dozen people from our hostel! We even got ice cream from down the street and paired it with Kim’s delicious desert.
                <br>
                <br>
                This past week we’re back at the Parla Hostel in Buenos Aires. We leave this Sunday to go to Iguazu Falls, the third biggest waterfall in the world. These past couple days have been filled with fun wandering around neighborhoods, desperate cafe breaks to get air conditioning amid the heat, and of course lots of yummy food. Last Tuesday we went out with our friend to a club in Palermo called Uptown. It’s designed to look like a NYC Subway station when you walk in. Inside, bartenders were wearing basketball jerseys that said Brooklyn and you could spot MetroCards all around the bar. We went back out to Palermo with other girls from our hostel on Friday to a club playing African music. It was an amazing late night that went until 4AM and it felt so good to dance!
                <br>
                <br>
                On Wednesday, we took a day trip with our friends from Britain to El Tigre, a cute town an hour train ride away from Buenos Aires. We feasted on ice cream, attempted climbing a tree, and drank some delicious fruit juices (inside of course, to again get a break from the heat). It was so sad to leave our friends after going to the music festival and hanging out in this past week. That being said, knowing we’ve already made friends that we can laugh, hang out with, and visit whenever we’re in the same place makes me so incredibly happy. Other highlights from the week include:
                <br>
                <br>
                - Seeing our first ever tango show in San Telmo amidst the grandness of the Sunday San Telmo Market<br>
                - Visiting a rose garden where kim taught me how to crochet! As I’m writing this, she’s at her crochet class. She tries to teach me everything she learns after. I’m currently working on making a lavender colored crop top. Photo updates soon to come<br>
                - Watching the new Black Panther movie in a 3D theater in Palermo! The movie was in English with Spanish subtitles. Couldn’t recommend a new movie more, I haven’t seen too many Marvel movies but this film awed me<br>
                - Going to the MALBA, an amazing contemporary art museum, and saw some of Frida Kahlo’s works<br>
                - Watching a Planetarium show about the creation of the universe<br>
                - Going on a run near the ecological reserve in the late afternoon when it was less hot out, it was so refreshing!<br>
                - Visiting an American bar to watch the UCLA vs USC game, met some USC fans while there and tried an amazing new drink: a mint fernet tonic<br>
                - Eating pizza, shawarma, tapas, empanadas, dulce de leche gelato, honey mustard chicken salad, bagels, and much more. I have a whole photo album on my phone dedicated to all we’ve eaten. We’re not eating well at all. We’re eating exquisitely! (haha not sure that’s even a word but making it one right now because the food is well deserving of it)<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                We’ve now been on our trip for 25 days, which is absolutely insane to me! Thanksgiving is on Thursday and we’re going to cook a pie in our hostel to share with people and then try to find a place to eat dinner that serves a traditional Thanksgiving (turkey, corn, mashed potatoes, and all the other good stuff). In true Thanksgiving spirit, I’m so incredibly grateful to have the time and ability to go on this trip. I’m grateful to get to experience all this with my best friend. I’m grateful to have gotten to meet so many kind people in these first weeks. I’m grateful to get to explore and learn more about the culture and history of the incredible cities we’ve been to and the ones soon to come. I’m grateful for the time to learn Spanish and read and practice hobbies I haven’t had time to do in the past. And I’m so grateful to have so many friends and family back at home to connect with and care about.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please eat some extra stuffing for us and have a great holiday,<br>

            <h3> A Week in Uruguay!</h3>
            <p>
                We saw Lorde at Primavera Sound music festival and it was amazing!!! Okay it’s been over a week since I’ve updated what we have been up to, and there are so many stories to tell about the past week and our trip to Uruguay. But first, picture this: rain pouring down as the sky turns purple and fades into night, bold and bright lights changing from blue to red to gold on a grand stage that is soaking wet, Lorde singing all of my favorite songs of hers, mosh pit dancing, endless laughing and smiling. All of this magic happened yesterday when Kim and I went to see Lorde with two of our friends we met at a hostel in Uruguay. The energy felt unified and liberating, it’s crazy to think that we had only bought our tickets two days before. What a wonderful welcome back to Buenos Aires!
            <br>
            <br>
            Last week we left Buenos Aires for Uruguay. We took a ferry across Rio de la Plata to Colonia Del Sacremento, where we stayed for two nights. Colonia is one of the oldest towns in Uruguay and its historical district is lined with stone roads and cute restaurants that looked similar to what the small Italian town looks like in Call Me By Your Name. However, we were quickly struck by how much more expensive everything was in this new country. Before coming on this trip I knew very little about the political situation in most South American countries but wanted to know more. Already visiting two countries, I have learned just how progressive Uruguay is. It is probably the most stable country in the continent. Seeing that in contrast to the inflation and history of political shifts in Argentina surprised me given that both countries are next to each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            Colonia and Montevideo really made me think more about this trip. Not being in the movement and vastness of Buenos Aires, the smaller towns gave me time to think more about what I would be doing every day and put perspective to the length of this trip. To be honest, I started to feel lonely. I have Kim of course but it really is an adjustment to go from knowing your group of solid friends in college to meeting and saying goodbye to so many people. As someone who is usually go go go, I also realized that this trip isn’t just about visiting cities, but taking time to do what I want to do. Things that I never had time to make big efforts to actively do on a day to day basis. Whether its reading more, doing yoga, or taking time to sit and think, these are all things I have been doing so much more and am so grateful to get this opportunity for it all.
            <br>
            <br>
            After Colonia, we bussed further east to Montevideo for a couple days. Given the priciness, we mostly cooked all of our own food during this week, cheap meals like pasta, in the hostel. Interestingly enough, meat and bread and dairy are pretty affordable, but exports, for example the $10 jar of Nutella, were quite expensive. We loved the social scene of our Montevideo hostel. Highlights include going out at night, going to the Feria de Tristan Narvaja (street fair), playing cards, visiting parks, and making sangria with friends from our hostel. Good life lesson: never attempt to buy tickets to anything after a couple of glasses of wine. I tried to buy Primavera Sound tickets and nearly spent $1000 USD thinking the currency was in Argentinian pesos. Dont worry, the tickets that we actually ended up getting a couple days later were only $60 a person. Phew.
            <br>
            <br>
            On November 8th, we left Montevideo for Punta del Este. It’s a beautiful and grand beach town that many wealthy Uruguayans and Argentineans visit for vacation. Highlights include:<br>
            - an incredibly nice hostel with a pool, view of the beach from its patio, games like boggle and chess, and we practically had the place all to ourselves <br>
            - Huge houses that lined the beach and a port with hundreds of beautiful sailboats <br>
            - Too many relaxing beach spots to read, do yoga, and watch the sunset from <br>
            - Moral of the story, it felt like we were truly in the ease of a relaxing vacation
            <br>
            <br>
            We met two girls our age from Britain in Montevideo and that really helped the trip click for me. Being able to hangout with them and talk with them felt so comfortable. We walked all around the city with them and went to the music festival it was awesome!
            <br>
            <br>
            This week: were back in Buenos Aires and just booked our tickets for Iguazu Falls! More to come on that in the next couple of days but conclusion to all of this, we are both so glad we spent time in Uruguay, definitely recommend because it is so beautiful and exciting.
            <br>

            Signing off,<br>

            <h3> The First Week Traveled</h3>
            <p>
                It feels like we already live here! I mean, I guess technically we are living here, but more in the sense that it feels like it’s our neighborhood and we have blocks and streets memorized. We have our favorite happy hour spot in San Telmo, have parks we already want to go back to, and we are now the people at the hostel welcoming newcomers when others used to welcome us. Even in these past couple days, I’ve learned perspective of just how long this trip is going to actually be (in the best way but also in the sense that I need to pace myself). We have had some pretty full days and I realized I have to slow down (haha which Kim did tell me on the first day but I couldn’t admit she was right until day five). If there’s anything I’ve realized about Buenos Aires beyond my fondness of it is that it’s the city of indulgences. It’s a city of cafes, ice cream, steak, incredible pastries, wine, dancing, singing, and love. The enjoyment of pleasures feels so grand and we are soaking it all in. It’s too much to write everything we’ve done but heres a short list

                <br>
                <br>

                - Visited a ton of fairs: San Telmo, Recoleta, Gaucho
                <br>
                - Kim took a crochet class and is learning so fast
                <br>
                - Visited the national library, a ton of parks
                <br>
                - Eaten more than our fair share of empanadas, gelato, and steak
                <br>
                - Joined a drumming class that we wandered into after drinking beer at our favorite happy hour place
                <br>
                - Bussed to Palermo and stumbled on a festive pride parade! Such a fun celebration. Tons of restaurants and stores have pride flags in the window
                <br>
                - Go to McDonalds whenever we need to go to the bathroom and get WiFi when we’re out and about
                <br>
                - Went to the halloween party on the rooftop of our hostel and then to a club nearby after. So many people wore incredibly thought out costumes it was so epic! Kim got back at 5am people party hard here
                <br>
                - Taken busses and the metro all over! Never have I loved the convenience and accessibility of a city’s transportation more
                <br>
                - Saw the movie Argentina, 1985 in theaters! We’re trying to learn a lot more about Argentinian history
                <br>
                - Reading in the park! Kim’s reading a book about Eva Peron and I’m reading about the history of Argentinian soccer in preparation for the World Cup in a couple weeks

                <br>
                <br>

                Signing off from Buenos Aires! We leave tomorrow for Uruguay for a week before coming back to the city for another two weeks. From there, who knows?!? Rosario, Cordoba, Iguazu Falls?!?
